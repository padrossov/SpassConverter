Samsung Pass lets you export your saved passwords as an encrypted `.spass` file — but no standard password manager can open it directly. SPASS Converter decrypts the file on your phone using your Samsung Pass password, then produces a CSV you can import straight into **Google Password Manager / Chrome**, **Bitwarden**, **1Password**, **KeePass**, or any tool that accepts the standard CSV format.

**Nothing ever leaves your device.** Every network permission is explicitly blocked at the manifest level.

## What gets exported

| Section | CSV columns |
|---------|-------------|
| Passwords | `name, url, username, password, note` |
| Addresses | `full_name, company_name, street_address, city, state, zipcode, country_code, phone_number, email` |
| Credit cards | `name_on_card, first_six_digits, last_four_digits, expiry_month, expiry_year` |

The password section is **directly importable** into Google Password Manager, Chrome, Bitwarden, and 1Password CSV import.

## FAQ

### How do I import Samsung Pass passwords into Google Password Manager?
Export from Samsung Pass (Settings → Export passwords) → convert with this app → import the CSV at [passwords.google.com](https://passwords.google.com) → Settings → Import passwords. The CSV column format matches exactly.

### How do I open a .spass file?
A `.spass` file is an AES-256 encrypted export from Samsung Pass. You cannot open it with a text editor or spreadsheet. Use SPASS Converter to decrypt it on your device and convert it to a readable CSV.

### Does this app upload my passwords anywhere?
No. The app has no internet connection at all — every network permission is explicitly removed in the manifest (`tools:node="remove"`). Decryption and conversion happen entirely in memory on your device.

### What's the Samsung Pass export password?
It's the password you use to unlock Samsung Pass itself — not your Samsung account password. You set it when you first configured Samsung Pass.

### Can I import into Bitwarden instead of Google?
Yes. In Bitwarden's web vault go to Tools → Import data → select **Google Chrome (CSV)** as the format, then upload the CSV. The column layout is compatible.

### Can I import into 1Password?
Yes. Use 1Password's built-in CSV import (File → Import → 1Password or Generic CSV). You may need to map columns during import.

### Does it work with Samsung Pass app passwords (android://)?
Yes. App passwords stored in Samsung Pass use `android://` URIs. SPASS Converter includes a resolver for 100+ common Android package names (Instagram, WhatsApp, Netflix, Spotify, Cash App, etc.) that maps them to real website URLs automatically.

### Is this open source?
Yes — MIT License. Source code is at [github.com/stanley-projects/SpassConverter](https://github.com/stanley-projects/SpassConverter).

## Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stanley-projects/SpassConverter.git
cd SpassConverter
./gradlew assembleRelease   # unsigned APK — no local.properties needed
```

For a signed release, add to `local.properties` (this file is gitignored):
```
RELEASE_STORE_FILE=/path/to/your.keystore
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=yourpassword
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=youralias
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=yourkeypassword
```

## GitHub Actions release builds

The **Release build** workflow runs on pushes to `master`, pushes of `v*` tags,
and manually from **Actions → Release build → Run workflow**.

It uses Java 21, the checked-in Gradle wrapper and Android SDK 36.1, runs unit
tests, and builds the minified release APK and Android App Bundle. Download
the APK, AAB, and R8 mapping artifacts
from the workflow run's **Artifacts** section. Artifacts are retained for 30 days.
This workflow builds artifacts; it does not publish a GitHub Release or upload
to Google Play.

Without signing secrets, the workflow generates a temporary test key and uploads
`SpassConverter-test-signed-apk` and `SpassConverter-test-signed-aab`. Extract the
APK from the artifact ZIP and open the `.apk` file on Android to install it.
The APK signature is verified before uploading.

**The test key changes on every run.** These builds cannot update a copy signed
with another key. Uninstall that copy first if needed; uninstalling deletes its
app data. Use your own permanent release key for updates and distribution.
The temporary private key is deleted and is never uploaded.

With all four secrets configured, artifacts are named
`SpassConverter-release-apk` and `SpassConverter-release-aab`.
Add repository Actions secrets under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded contents of your release keystore |
| `RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD` | Keystore password |
| `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS` | Signing key alias |
| `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD` | Signing key password |

Use the existing app's signing key if the APK must update an installed copy.
The workflow fails if only some signing secrets are configured. The keystore
and temporary signing properties are removed after the build and are never
uploaded as artifacts. App versions remain controlled by `app/build.gradle.kts`.
